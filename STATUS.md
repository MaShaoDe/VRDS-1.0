# Project Status

Project: VRDS – Vehicle Relay Distribution System

Last updated: 2026-01-20

## Current State

The VRDS project is in an early concept and system definition phase.

No hardware has been finalised.
No schematics exist yet.
No firmware or software has been implemented.

The focus is currently on defining a clean, minimal and vehicle-suitable system architecture.

## Active Concept Documents

The following concept documents exist and are valid for discussion:

- CONCEPT.md  
  Primary system concept and baseline assumptions.

- CONCEPT_PHASE2.md  
  Alternative and extended ideas under evaluation.

Both documents are exploratory. No final decision has been made between them yet.

## Decisions Made

- VRDS is designed as a modular relay-based vehicle power distribution system.
- The system targets automotive and campervan environments.
- Simplicity, repairability and electrical robustness are core principles.
- The project language is English.

## Open Questions

- Final relay grouping strategy
- Final current limits per channel
- Optional monitoring features such as shunt or current sensing
- Physical form factor and mounting strategy

## Out of Scope (for now)

The following topics are intentionally not part of the current phase:

- Detailed schematics
- Bill of materials
- PCB layout
- Firmware or control software
- Installation instructions

## Stability Notice

All documents may change as the project evolves.
Nothing in this repository should be considered production-ready at this stage.
