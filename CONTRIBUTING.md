# Contributing to VRDS

Thank you for your interest in the VRDS project.

VRDS is currently in an early concept and system definition phase.
Contributions are welcome, but the scope is intentionally limited.

## Current Contribution Scope

At this stage, the project primarily accepts:

- Conceptual feedback and system-level discussion
- Review of assumptions and design principles
- Identification of potential flaws or edge cases
- Suggestions related to vehicle safety and robustness

## What Is Not Accepted (for now)

The following contributions are intentionally out of scope at this stage:

- Detailed schematics or PCB layouts
- Bill of materials proposals
- Firmware or software implementations
- Feature requests not grounded in the existing concepts
- Large refactors or unsolicited restructurings

## How to Contribute

- Open an issue for discussion or questions
- Keep feedback technical, concise and focused
- Reference existing documents where applicable

Pull requests may be ignored or closed if they do not align with the current project phase.

## Project Direction

VRDS prioritises simplicity, repairability and real-world vehicle use.
Not every idea needs to be implemented.

The project owner reserves the right to decide which contributions are integrated.

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful.
Stay technical.
Avoid speculation or marketing language.
